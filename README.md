# Spinzen
This is a Blender Game Engine remake of Cameltry, a well-remembered Taito arcade game. [Rare](https://github.com/heyitzrare) (lead designer at TNM Dev Team) was working on it while he was still in high school, but he ended up abandoning it in early 2020.

Here are all of the builds he could find, released to the public domain - do whatever you want with them! Finish the game, use their assets in your own project, or just poke around the files - we don't mind, they're yours now. Enjoy ‚ù§

# Heads up!
You'll need [Blender 2.79b](https://www.blender.org/download/previous-versions/) to open these files - Blender Game Engine is no longer present in 2.80 and onward.
